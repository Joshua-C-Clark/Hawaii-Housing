# Hawaii-Housing

## Overview

This project explores the Hotel Occupancy and Tourist Arrival Rates between January 1999 - March 2021.

## Preliminary Goals

- Correlate changes in tourist arrivals to major US Events.
- Determine statistical significance of monthly changes via bootstrap sampling.
- Determine peak months and compare to predicted months from personal historical observation.
- Explore hotel occupancy rate and attempt to correlate any significant decline to the genesis of AirBnB.

## Data

All data was obtained from [Hawaii Government Travel Statistics](https://dbedt.hawaii.gov/visitor/). The concatenated data is contained in [data.csv](https://github.com/Joshua-C-Clark/Hawaii-Housing/blob/main/data.csv) and is available for future projects and use.
